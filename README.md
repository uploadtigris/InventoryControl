#### Title: Inventory Control Management Database

## Introduction

### Overview

The **Inventory Control Management Database** project aims to design and implement a database system that efficiently manages inventory data for businesses. This system will help track stock levels, monitor orders, and optimize supplier relationships.
### Primary Technologies Used:

- **SQL**: Used for creating and managing the relational database.
- **Python**: Utilized for data analysis and visualization tasks.
- **Tableau or Power BI**: Employed for data visualization to provide insights into inventory trends.
## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Sources:

- **Existing Inventory Records**: Collect historical inventory data from existing systems.
- **Supplier Information**: Gather data on suppliers, including contact details and product offerings.
- **Order Data**: Collect data on customer and supplier orders.
### Data Types:

- **Numerical Data**: Stock quantities, order amounts.
- **Categorical Data**: Product categories, supplier names.
### Data Cleaning:

- **Handle Missing Values**: Use SQL to identify and fill missing values.
- **Data Normalization**: Normalize data to ensure consistency across different tables.
### Data Transformation:

- **Create Derived Fields**: Calculate fields like total stock value or average order size.
## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Summary Statistics:

- **Mean and Median Stock Levels**: Calculate average stock levels across different products.
- **Standard Deviation of Order Volumes**: Analyze variability in order sizes.
### Data Visualization:

- **Histograms**: Visualize stock level distributions using Python libraries like `matplotlib`.
- **Scatter Plots**: Show relationships between stock levels and order volumes.
### Correlation Analysis:

- **Identify Correlated Variables**: Use Python to find correlations between stock levels and order frequencies.
## Modeling and Analysis

### Model Selection:

- **Regression Models**: Use linear regression to predict stock levels based on historical data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Apply ARIMA models to forecast future stock needs.
### Model Implementation:

- **Python Libraries**: Use `scikit-learn` for regression and `statsmodels` for time series analysis.
### Model Evaluation:

- **Metrics**: Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE for regression and MAE for time series forecasting.
## Results Interpretation

### Key Findings:

- **Stock Level Trends**: Identify seasonal trends in stock levels.
- **Supplier Performance**: Analyze supplier reliability based on order fulfillment rates.
### Implications:

- **Inventory Optimization**: Use findings to optimize stock levels and reduce waste.
- **Supplier Management**: Improve supplier relationships by identifying reliable partners.
## Conclusions

### Summary of Key Points:

- **Efficient Inventory Management**: The database system enhances inventory tracking and analysis.
- **Business Value**: Provides actionable insights for optimizing stock levels and supplier relationships.
### Future Directions:

- **Integration with Real-Time Data**: Integrate the system with real-time data collection tools like RFID or IoT sensors.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Explore using machine learning models for predictive inventory management.
## Appendices

### Data Dictionary:

- **Product Table**: Product ID, Name, Description, SKU.
- **Supplier Table**: Supplier ID, Name, Contact Details.
- **Order Table**: Order ID, Date, Quantity, Status.
## Technical Details:

- **Database Schema**: Include a detailed schema of the relational database.
- **Code Snippets**: Provide examples of SQL queries and Python scripts used for analysis.
## Raw Data and Code:

- **Access to Raw Data**: Include links or descriptions of how to access raw data.
- **Code Repository**: Link to a GitHub repository containing all project code.
